# Deep-Sort-Tracker

This repository contains the code for a deep-learning based multi-object tracker (MoT) to track the pedestrian. With that being said, this MoT can be derived to track other objects like cars, animals, etc. The tracking model is trained on [Market1501 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pengcw1/market-1501), which obtained a more than 90% accuracy.
